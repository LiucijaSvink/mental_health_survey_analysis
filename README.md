## Introduction

In this project, a survey which aims to measure the frequency of mental health disorders and the attitude towards the mental health of people working in the technology field is analyzed. Our goal is to determine the prevalence of mental health issues among the respondents and find out what are the attitudes towards mental health in the workplace. 

## Data

The SQLite database which contains 3 tables (Survey, Question and Answer) was used. The database can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anth7310/mental-health-in-the-tech-industry).

## Insights

* In comparison to the general population, the proportion of the survey respondents experiencing mental health issues is higher.
* When treated effectively, the disorder seems to interfere with work less. Therefore, actions should be taken to help employees to manage mental disorders and support their mental well-being.
* Employees seem to recognise the employers' effort in educating them about potential help resources. However, most respondents perceived physical health as more emphasised by the employer than mental health. It should be further investigated why this is the case and how it can be improved.
* Even though more people seem to be seeking help when experiencing mental problems in recent years, most of them do not feel comfortable talking about mental issues with their current or future employers.
